# 🚀 DSA 30 Days Revision Challenge using C++

Welcome to my 30-day Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) revision journey using C++!  
This repository contains my daily practice code, notes, and problem solutions as I revise and implement core DSA concepts from scratch.

## 📝 Daily Folder Template

Each day will have:

- C++ files for problems
- `readme.md` for notes, observations, and problem links

### 🧾 Example: `Day05/readme.md`

```md
## Day 05: Binary Search & Applications

### ✅ Topics Covered

- Binary Search (Recursive & Iterative)
- First and Last Occurrence
- Binary Search on Answers

### 💻 Problems Solved

- [LeetCode 34](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)
- [GFG - Search in Rotated Array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-rotated-array)

### 🧠 Notes

- Always prefer `mid = low + (high - low)/2` to prevent overflow
- Binary Search can also be applied to answers, not just indices (e.g., finding minimum in "is valid" range)

### 🧪 Output
```

> Enter array: 1 2 2 2 3 4
> Search element: 2
> Output: First Occurrence = 1, Last Occurrence = 3

```

```

## 🙌 Motivation

- To prepare for SDE interviews
- To revise all patterns and templates used in coding rounds
- To build consistency and practice discipline
